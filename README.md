Custom cogs made for [Red DiscordBot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) by
Laggron for the Discord server of [Bronol](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bronol). This is made
with Python using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

Those cogs are used for this Discord server's usage and not intended for public usage. It is
still open-source, but user feedback is not always considered. If you're looking for approved
3rd party cogs for Red Discord Bot, you should look at my other repo,
[Laggron's Dumb Cogs](https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs), which contains cogs made for
everyone and with better support of user feedback.

This repo mostly contains french, and will not be submitted to the approved repositories of
[Red's cogboard](https://cogboard.red/).
